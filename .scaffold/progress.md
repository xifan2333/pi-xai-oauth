# Execution Progress — Issue #93

**Branch:** feature/issue-93-pi-0.80.10
**Baseline:** 579f965

## Completed

- [x] Confirmed both Pi peers publish 0.80.10 inside the existing allowed range.
- [x] Reviewed official v0.80.8, v0.80.9, and v0.80.10 release notes.
- [x] Ran the clean packed 0.80.10 candidate matrix; it exposed the 0.80.8 credential-runtime migration in startup reads and integration tests.
- [x] Updated startup credential discovery to prefer `readStoredCredential()` with a JSON-only Pi 0.80.1 fallback that never creates credential storage.
- [x] Updated the credential-persistence integration test to use `ModelRuntime` and `InMemoryCredentialStore` on current Pi while retaining its legacy path.
- [x] Focused credential and catalog-race regressions pass on Pi 0.80.10.
- [x] Updated policy latest, exact dev dependencies, lockfile, README, CHANGELOG, AGENTS, assertion parity, and scaffold state.
- [x] Full strict tests, coverage, loader smoke, typecheck, live registry/pack/unsupported checks, clean 0.80.10 candidate, and exact packed 0.80.1/0.80.10 boundaries pass.
- [x] Retargeted issue #93 from the superseded 0.80.9 release to current Pi 0.80.10.

- [x] Independent final review reported CLEAN after the no-write startup regression was added and verified on both exact boundaries.
- [x] Reproduced the first CI-only minimum failure under npm 11.6.2 and removed the legacy test's global OAuth-registry identity assumption; the exact 0.80.1 packed matrix now passes under CI's resolver.

## Delivery

- [x] Committed the reviewed implementation as `a74b9e3` (`chore: validate Pi 0.80.10 compatibility`).
- [x] Pushed `feature/issue-93-pi-0.80.10` and opened PR #94: https://github.com/BlockedPath/pi-xai-oauth/pull/94

## Residual

- No live xAI authentication or model request is part of this offline compatibility gate.
