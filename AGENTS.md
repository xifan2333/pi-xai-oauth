# AGENTS.md — AI Agent Operations Manual for pi-xai-oauth

> **For AI coding agents only.** Keep this file machine-readable and concise. Human-facing docs live in README.md.

## Project Overview
pi-xai-oauth is a pi-package that registers the xAI OAuth provider (`xai-auth`) and the authenticated account's OAuth-visible Grok model catalog for the pi coding agent framework, with Grok 4.5 as the curated offline fallback.

Core flow: `bin/setup.js` → `pi install` → bounded catalog selection in `extensions/xai/catalog.ts` → provider registration in `extensions/xai-oauth.ts` → browser PKCE or bounded device authorization in `extensions/xai/oauth.ts` / `extensions/xai/device-auth.ts` → pinned browser OIDC/JWKS validation in `extensions/xai/oidc.ts` → streaming via xAI API helpers in `extensions/xai/responses.ts`; explicit revision-pinned subscription usage lives in `extensions/xai/usage.ts`.

## Key Commands (Exact, Copy-Paste Ready)
- Install / setup: `node bin/setup.js` or `npm run setup`
- Install as pi extension: `pi install npm:pi-xai-oauth`
- Full policy/unit/loader gate: `npm test`
- Focused Vitest suite: `npm run test:unit -- tests/oauth/browser-login.test.ts`
- V8 coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
- Real Pi loader smoke: `npm run test:loader`
- Run TypeScript: `npm run typecheck` (production, tests, fixtures, config)
- Verify Pi policy/package metadata: `npm run compatibility:check`
- Verify exact packed Pi boundaries: `npm run compatibility:boundaries`
- Evaluate an unadvertised Pi candidate: `node scripts/run-compatibility-matrix.js X.Y.Z --candidate`
- Git: Always work on feature branches and confirm the active branch before edits.

## Architecture & Boundaries (MUST / MUST NOT)
**MUST:**
- Register providers via `pi.registerProvider("xai-auth", { ... })`
- Keep browser PKCE S256 with local callback server as the first/default login method
- Offer device authorization through pi's native selector/device-code callbacks for remote/headless human login
- Pin the device and token endpoints; wait before polling; honor interval plus cumulative slow-down; bound expiry; propagate cancellation
- Require matching state for every HTTP or pasted browser authorization callback before token exchange
- Validate retained fresh-login ID tokens against pinned first-party discovery/JWKS, ES256, issuer, audience, expiry, and nonce
- Support reasoning levels: none / low / medium / high
- Reuse `~/.grok/auth.json` when possible without deleting or revoking it
- Fetch OAuth-visible models only from the pinned authenticated CLI proxy `/models-v2` endpoint
- Treat successful catalog responses as exact entitlement state; additions appear and removals disappear
- Keep the normalized token-free catalog cache atomic and apply the documented TTL/stale/fallback policy
- Preserve known model metadata and compatibility behavior without inventing unentitled model families; known aliases and independently verified OAuth request slugs may be advertised only while their entitlement source is present at registration/runtime (cache stays exact)
- Keep both Pi peers aligned to the checked-in bounded range in `compatibility/pi-versions.json`
- Install/report exact Pi matrix versions from a clean packed package; never reuse the repository lockfile for boundary jobs
- Keep normal Pi dev dependencies exact at the policy's latest tested release and review candidate releases before widening support
- Resolve `x-userid` transiently from the pinned authenticated CLI-proxy `/user` endpoint before any billing request
- Keep `/xai-usage` explicit, and keep its optional status off by default, session-scoped, bounded, and inactive outside xAI models

**MUST NOT:**
- Hardcode API keys (use OAuth only)
- Accept raw authorization codes or callbacks with missing/mismatched state
- Trust arbitrary `*.x.ai` discovery, device, token, verification, or JWKS endpoints
- Log or reflect authorization codes, opaque device codes, tokens, PKCE verifiers, state, nonce, device/token response bodies, or authenticated request headers
- Cache raw `/models-v2` responses, credentials, identity fields, endpoint URLs, or known API-key-only models
- Persist, cache, log, or display `/user` identity, authenticated usage headers, or raw authenticated usage bodies
- Send `/billing?format=credits` when the transient authenticated `/user` lookup is missing, malformed, cancelled, oversized, redirected, or unsuccessful
- Trust catalog-provided endpoints or route non-Responses models through the OAuth provider
- Delete or revoke existing user credentials during validation
- Modify core pi-coding-agent internals
- Touch unrelated extensions or skills
- Skip error handling on OAuth refresh

## Style & Quality Rules
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer async/await for OAuth and API calls
- Add JSDoc for all exported functions
- Keep OAuth callback server minimal and secure
- Keep raw browser authorization codes rejected; direct users to device login or a complete matching-state redirect URL
- Never log OAuth codes, opaque device codes, tokens, device/token response bodies, verifiers, state, nonce, catalog request headers, or raw authenticated catalog bodies
- Never retain a device-flow ID token without a device-specific validation policy; browser ID tokens keep nonce-bound OIDC validation
- Keep caller/model reserved headers scrubbed before appending the route-specific contract; never reflect raw transport error bodies
- Reject malformed, hidden, unsupported-backend, secret-bearing, and known API-key-only catalog entries
- Keep startup catalog network behavior bounded and use pi's credential lock for expired stored-token refresh
- Keep usage redirects, timeouts, response bytes, JSON complexity, history counts, and numeric ranges bounded; redact every usage error
- Clear optional usage status on model, provider, account, and session changes, and never refresh it for non-xAI models
- Keep compatibility policy/registry/pack/resolver verification in plain Node; behavior tests use focused Vitest suites
- Isolate fetch, timers, environment, temp HOME/filesystem, module state, runtime models, credentials, and active-tool registries per test
- Keep real callback tests sequential with real timers and guaranteed listener cleanup
- Use strict peer resolution for supported versions; `--force` is allowed only in isolated negative fixtures that assert npm peer warnings

## Safety Gates
- Before any file edit: run `git status` and confirm on correct branch
- Before committing: ensure `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, and both exact compatibility boundaries pass
- For multi-agent work: always use the subagent tool with explicit parallel or chain mode
- External state lives in `.scaffold/` — update progress.md after every major step

## Multi-Agent Workflow (Preferred)
When complex work is needed:
1. Use `subagent` in PARALLEL mode for research + planning
2. Delegate to specialized agents (researcher, planner, reviewer, worker)
3. Save outputs to `.scaffold/` files
4. Review with `reviewer` agent before implementation

## Persistent State (Use These Files)
- `.scaffold/plan.md` — Current implementation plan with steps and owners
- `.scaffold/constraints.md` — Hard rules and boundaries
- `.scaffold/progress.md` — What has been done + next actions
- `.scaffold/context.md` — Shared context for handoff between agents

## Next Steps When Starting Fresh
1. Read this AGENTS.md + README.md
2. Run `git checkout -b feature/your-task`
3. Check `.scaffold/plan.md` for current work
4. Use parallel subagents for heavy lifting

This file should be updated whenever architecture, commands, or rules change.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

This repo is a **pi extension package (a library/CLI), not a standalone server**. There is nothing to "boot" — dependency install happens automatically via the startup update script (`npm ci`). Node engine note: the pi peer deps request Node `>=22.19.0` and the pod ships `22.14.0`, so `npm ci` prints `EBADENGINE` warnings; these are non-blocking — typecheck, tests, and extension load all pass.

- Build / typecheck gate: `npm run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`). There is **no separate lint tool** configured; typecheck is the static gate.
- Tests: `npm test` runs compatibility policy, focused Vitest regressions, and the small real Pi loader smoke. Use `npm run test:coverage` for V8 output and `npm run test:unit -- <path> -t <name>` for focus.
- Running the "app": full end-to-end use (`pi`, `/login xai-auth`, live Grok streaming) needs the external `pi` CLI, an interactive browser OAuth flow, and a real xAI/Grok account, so it is **not runnable headless** here. Offline behavior lives in focused `tests/` suites with isolated fixtures; `npm run test:loader` exercises the real Pi loader without live xAI access. Catalog fixtures live under `tests/fixtures/models-v2/`.
- Any temporary demo script that imports deps must live inside the repo root (so it resolves `node_modules`), not `/tmp`.
