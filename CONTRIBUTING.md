### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BlockedPath/pi-xai-oauth.git
cd pi-xai-oauth

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the complete policy + focused unit + real-loader suite
npm test
npm run typecheck

# Run one suite or one named regression while developing
npm run test:unit -- tests/catalog/cache.test.ts
npm run test:unit -- -t "invalidates stale entitlements"
npm run test:watch

# Run measured V8 coverage and the loader smoke independently
npm run test:coverage
npm run test:loader

# Fail on leaked asynchronous errors
NODE_OPTIONS=--unhandled-rejections=strict npm test

# Verify compatibility policy, package metadata, and unsupported peers
npm run compatibility:check

# Verify the exact minimum/latest Pi boundaries from a clean packed package
npm run compatibility:boundaries

# Test the CLI
node bin/setup.js --help
```

## Pi Compatibility and Release Changes

The compatibility contract lives in `compatibility/pi-versions.json`. Both Pi peer ranges must remain aligned, normal development dependencies must be exact at the policy's `latest` release, and CI derives its two exact matrix cells from that policy.

To evaluate a future Pi release without advertising it prematurely:

```bash
node scripts/run-compatibility-matrix.js X.Y.Z --candidate
```

This changes metadata only inside a temporary extracted tarball. For a patch inside the allowed line, update the policy `latest`, both exact Pi dev dependencies, and `package-lock.json` only after the candidate passes. For a new pre-1.0 minor, keep the existing upper bound during evaluation and widen it only after the exact candidate passes the full packed tests/typecheck and review. If the minimum changes, test the immediately previous published release as unsupported and document the support break.

The xAI wire contract has an independent review process in [`compatibility/grok-build-wire-protocol.md`](compatibility/grok-build-wire-protocol.md). Pin an immutable upstream Grok Build commit, trace header/ID ownership from source, preserve the package's truthful identity and pinned routes, update request-shape/privacy tests, and never copy an official client version merely to bypass a gate. Encrypted reasoning changes must preserve the documented opaque replay, route/model isolation, local-session privacy, and redacted terminal-error contract.

Every dependency/compatibility PR and release must run:

```bash
npm test
NODE_OPTIONS=--unhandled-rejections=strict npm test
npm run test:coverage
npm run typecheck
npm run compatibility:check
npm run compatibility:boundaries
npm pack --dry-run --json
git diff --check
```

Do not use `--legacy-peer-deps` or `--force` for supported-version validation. The verifier uses `--force` only inside temporary negative fixtures to prove npm emits peer warnings for unsupported hosts.

## Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer async/await for OAuth and API calls
- Add JSDoc for all exported functions
- Keep OAuth callback server minimal and secure
- Never log sensitive tokens
